            <h2>What is this website about?</h2>
            <p>This is a sudoku-solving program. It solves any sudoku puzzle if it has a solution. I've made it in my free time. Feel free to use it for your personal use.<p>
            <br>
            <p>Usage:  Fill in the sudoku with values. The highlighted button is the one currently selected. Make sure you enter it correcty and press solve. The solution will be presented to you after that unless it has no solution. The clear button clears the whole board and the Default button deletes individual values when clicked on.</p>
            <br>
            <p>The import button has not been implemented yet. But it will be soon.</p>
